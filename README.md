## Stack

- React 19 with SWC-powered Vite dev server.
- React Router v7 for SPA navigation.
- TanStack Query v5 + Axios for API calls, caching, and devtools.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The dev server runs at <http://localhost:5173>. Update files inside `src/` to
start building your application. By default, the app shows the login screen; the
dashboard becomes accessible only after a successful sign-in (guarded entirely
on the client for now).
